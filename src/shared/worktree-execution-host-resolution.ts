/**
 * One rule for "which host does this worktree execute on, and what connection routes there".
 *
 * Main and the renderer both have to answer it — the terminal launch scope picks a PTY route from
 * it, the renderer picks a file-read route and the reconnect affordance from it — so the rule lives
 * here instead of being re-derived per side. Two re-derivations already disagreed: main answered
 * from the worktree's own host while the renderer fell back to an id-only repo lookup, so a pane on
 * `ssh:m4air` was offered "Reconnect openclaw" and read its files off openclaw (#11163).
 *
 * `unresolved` is a distinct answer, never "local": the same repo id can exist on a local, an SSH
 * and a runtime host at once, and loss of a usable answer must fail closed rather than authorize a
 * client-side read of a remote path (#6648, #17799).
