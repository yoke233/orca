/**
 * The one place an agent is actually started — for the surfaces moved onto it, which today is
 * `agent.launch` alone. Orchestration dispatch, mobile create, CLI create and the desktop agent
 * tab each still start agents their own way; moving them here is later stack work.
 *
 * The mode decision is shared, not copied: `agent-launch-mode` owns it, and
 * `orchestration-worker-start-mode` is a thin adapter over it supplying orchestration's receipt
 * vocabulary. What this module adds is the *sequencing*, and the sequencing is where the bug
 * was:
 *
 *   create the worktree agent-first  ->  its startup terminal IS the agent
 *                                    ->  the structured branch below it is unreachable
 *
 * so every new-worktree launch was a PTY no matter what the user's default said. The order here is
 * the inverse, and it is the whole point of the module: when the preference is structured the
 * worktree is created with NO startup agent, the executing host is then asked whether it can host
 * a session for the workspace that now exists, and only then is a surface created. A refusal
 * becomes a terminal agent in the worktree just created, never a failed launch.
 *
 * The host verdict cannot be hoisted above creation: `agentSession.createSupport` can only answer
 * for a workspace it can resolve. That is why the decision is in two halves rather than one.
 *
 * What genuinely differs per surface is only how a surface is *built* — an orchestration worker's
 * session takes a dispatch hold and a mailbox that a plain launch must not take — so that is
 * injected as a factory instead of branched on here.
